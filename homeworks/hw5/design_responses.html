                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned is a good UI interaction screen often has moving images. Furthmore, there are appealing transitions to present the images. Lastly, these transitions and images provide for a pleasant UI experience. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was going through the creative images. It is interesting to see how each is designed. It is also intriguing to see how vivid the colors are used to depict an appealing UI experience.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The Add to Cart Interaction by Danniel for Norde was one of the my favorite inspirations. This is because I have never seen an effect that allows you to open the page from the middle. It is similar to a curtain unveiling the product. This interface achieves its goal by bringing users a visually pleasant experience and image. </p>
