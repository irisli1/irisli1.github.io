            <li> Something I learned from this article is that when designing a product, four concepts are always kept in mind: hierarchy, content, intent and audience. 
            When desigining a product, always ask questions such as "Why would someone open this app?" "What attracts them to open this app?". </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this article is learning about how many things are kept in mind when designing a product. Also, I liked how the author specifies the Search Bar instead of just putting search to mentioning a specific city.</li>
            <li> A quote I found compelling: "It’s not just “Add a Tweet”, it’s “Add another Tweet”" </li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10, I enjoyed reading this article to a level of 7.</li>
