					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article are the duration and speed of the animation. The optimal speed for animations is typically between 200 and 500ms. In the article, the comparison to an animal is a horse represents 200ms and a snail represents 500ms. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is seeing the illustration that shows the amount of time it takes for animation depending on the size of the object and the distance it traveled. I enjoy learning about how small objects compare to large objects. It is interesting to learn about how large objects make bigger offsets causing them to move slower.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  Therefore, if you have several elements that you want to animate, you need to clearly define the sequence of their motion and to animate as minimum objects as possible at one time. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
